# 🤖 Predicting the Sum of Two Numbers with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict the sum of two numbers. It includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

### 📋 Overview
- The idea behind this project is simple: given two input numbers, we aim to predict their sum using a linear regression model. This involves several steps, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and creating a web application for user interaction.
- Tech Used: Python, Streamlit, and popular libraries. 🐍

### 📊 Data Preparation
- Load the dataset containing pairs of numbers and their sums. 📂
- Perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the data. 🔍

### 🏗️ Model Building
- Split the data into training and testing sets. 🔄
- Train a linear regression model on the training data. 🧠
  
### 📈 Model Evaluation
- Test the model on unseen data to check its performance. 🧪
- Look at metrics like R² Score and Mean Absolute Error to see how well it predicts. 📊

### 🌟 Visualization
- Plot the data points and the regression line to visualize the fit. 🎨

### 💾 Model Persistence
- Save the trained model for future use using pickle. 💾

### 🌐 Building the Web App
- Create a simple web application with Streamlit where users can input two numbers. 🖥️
- Get the predicted sum as output. 📲

### ☁️ Deployment
- Deploy the model on Hugging Face Cloud to make it accessible online. 🌍
