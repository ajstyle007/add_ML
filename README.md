### 📋 Overview
- The idea behind this project is simple: given two input numbers, we aim to predict their sum using a linear regression model. This involves several steps, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and creating a web application for user interaction.
- Tech Used: Python 🐍, Streamlit, and popular libraries. 

### 📊 Data Preparation
- Load the dataset containing pairs of numbers and their sums. 📂
- Perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the data. 🔍

### 🏗️ Model Building
- Split the data into training and testing sets. 🔄
- Train a linear regression model on the training data. 🧠
  
### 📈 Model Evaluation
- Test the model on unseen data to check its performance. 🧪
- Look at metrics like R² Score and Mean Absolute Error to see how well it predicts. 📊

### 🌟 Visualization
- Plot the data points and the regression line to visualize the fit. 🎨

### 💾 Model Persistence
- Save the trained model for future use using pickle. 💾

### 🌐 Building the Web App
